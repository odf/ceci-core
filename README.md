About
-----

Ceci is a Javascript library inspired by [Go](http://golang.org/)'s channels and goroutines and by [Clojure](http://clojure.org/)'s [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async/). It depends on ES6 generators and requires a preprocessor to run under Javascript engines that do not yet support those. An easy way to use Ceci directly right now is under NodeJS 0.11.6 or higher with the `--harmony` option.

Ceci currently has three parts or layers, where each subsequent layer depends on the previous ones. The first layer [ceci-core](https://github.com/odf/ceci-core) provides a mechanism for integrating asynchronous, non-blocking calls into Javascript code as if they were blocking. The second layer [ceci-channels](https://github.com/odf/ceci-channels) adds blocking channels as Ceci's primary message passing abstraction. The third layer [ceci-filters](https://github.com/odf/ceci-filters) provides higher order functions like `map`, `filter`, `reduce` and so on that operate on channels.

Tutorial
--------

Just like other generator-based async libraries, ceci-core lets one integrate asynchronous, non-blocking calls into Javascript code in much the same manner as one would use regular blocking calls. This is achieved by a combination of two abstractions: go blocks and deferred values. The implementation tries to avoid unnecessary overhead as much as possible, so that many go blocks can run concurrently and communicate which each other efficiently.

Let's look at a simple example:

```javascript    
var cc = require('ceci-core');

console.log("I am main");

cc.go(function*() {
  yield console.log("I am go block 1");
  yield console.log("I am go block 1");
});

cc.go(function*() {
  yield console.log("I am go block 2");
  yield console.log("I am go block 2");
});

console.log("I am also main");
```

The output looks like this:

    I am main
    I am also main
    I am go block 1
    I am go block 2
    I am go block 1
    I am go block 2

Two go blocks are created by calling the `go` function with a generator argument (using the `function*` keyword). The blocks run after the main program is finished. Whenever an expression preceded by `yield` is encountered, the current go block pauses after evaluating the expression, so that the other one can run.

This gives us concurrency, but what about asynchronous computation? Let's simulate one by writing a simple function that delivers a value after a delay:

```javascript
var cc = require('ceci-core');

var after = function(ms, val) {
  var result = cc.defer();

  setTimeout(function() {
    result.resolve(val.split('').reverse().join(''));
  }, ms);

  return result;
};
```

The function `after` here returns a deferred value `result` which is resolved within the callback to `setTimeout`. This pattern may look a bit familiar to those who have worked with promises, but Ceci's deferreds are much simpler. Here's how we can use them in go blocks:

```javascript
var done = false;

cc.go(function*() {
  console.log(yield after(1000, ".ereht era eW"));
  done = true;
});

cc.go(function*() {
  var x;
  for (;;) {
    x = yield after(100, "?tey ereht ew erA");
    if (done)
      break;
    else
      console.log(x);
  }
});
```

The output looks like this:

    Are we there yet?
    Are we there yet?
    Are we there yet?
    Are we there yet?
    Are we there yet?
    Are we there yet?
    Are we there yet?
    Are we there yet?
    Are we there yet?
    We are there.

A `yield` with an expression that evaluates to a deferred suspends the current go block. When the deferred is resolved, the block is scheduled to be resumed with the resulting value. From inside the block, this looks exactly like a blocking function call, except for the fact that we needed to add the `yield` keyword. In this example, while the first go block is suspended, the second one can execute its loop a number of times. It is important to remember that Javascript is single-threaded, which means that executing a `yield` is the only way for a go block to be suspended and allow event handlers or other go blocks to run.

Another point worth noting is that Ceci's deferreds are not meant to be passed along and shared like promises. They are basically throw-away objects with the single purpose of decoupling the producer and consumer of a value. This is because Ceci's higher-level facilities for composing asynchronous computations are based on blocking channels as in Go rather than promises, and the extra functionality such as support for multiple callbacks or chaining is not needed at this level. That said, Ceci also lets us apply a `yield` directly to a promise, which can come in handy when working with libraries that already provide these. To demonstrate, let's rewrite the `after` function from above so that it uses the [q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/tree/v0.9) library to construct a promise:

```javascript
var Q = require('q');
var cc = require('ceci-core');

var after = function(ms, val) {
  var deferred = Q.defer();

  setTimeout(function() {
    deferred.resolve(val.split('').reverse().join(''));
  }, ms);

  return deferred.promise;
};
```

This produces exactly the same output when used with the remaining code from the previous example.

To finish off with a slightly more complex example, we will write a small NodeJS application that prints out a file with line numbers prepended to every fifth line. We start with a wrapper for the `readFile` function from Node's `fs` library:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var cc = require('ceci-core');

var content = function(path) {
  var result = cc.defer();

  fs.readFile(path, { encoding: 'utf8' }, function(err, val) {
    if (err)
      result.reject(new Error(err));
    else
      result.resolve(val);
  });

  return result;
};
```

The only thing new here is the `reject` method on deferreds. Its effect is for the go block that the deferred is used in to throw an exception, which is often more useful than throwing directly from within a callback.

The next function reads a file via `content` and splits it into individual lines:

```javascript
var readLines = function(path) {
  return cc.go(function*() {
    return (yield content(path)).split('\n');
  });
};
```

This shows how go blocks can be used in a straightforward way to pass on results of asynchronous computations. The call to `go` returns a deferred which is eventually resolved with the return value from the go block itself. We can now use this from another go block in the usual way:

```javascript
cc.go(function*() {
  var lines = yield readLines(process.argv[2]);

  for (var i = 1; i <= lines.length; ++i)
    console.log((i % 5 == 0 ? i : '') + '\t' + lines[i-1]);
});
```

Go blocks and deferreds get us out of "callback hell" and avoid the typical fragmentation of program logic associated with asynchronous programming. They are a great solution when all we need is to chain together a number of asynchronous calls with some interspersed computation. But the real power of asynchronous computation comes from the ability to do things in parallel, which leads to the problem of maintaining state. In the "Are we there yet?" example, we used a global variable `done` to communicate information between two concurrent go blocks, which is clearly not ideal when things get more complex. Ceci's subsequent layer [ceci-channels](https://github.com/odf/ceci-channels) provides blocking channels, borrowed from the Go language, and from Clojure's core.async, as a message passing abstraction on top of go blocks and deferreds.
