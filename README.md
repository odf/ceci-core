About
-----

Ceci's take on concurrency is inspired by [Go](http://golang.org/)'s channels and goroutines, and by the [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async/) library for [Clojure](http://clojure.org/). Both are strongly influenced by Tony Hoare's theory of communicating sequential processes (CSP), and somewhat related to the classical Unix concept of pipes. The common feature of all these approaches is the idea of providing a single communication mechanism, usually called a channel, between concurrent threads of execution (processes, threads, goroutines etc) with semantics that make it both practical and comparatively easy to reason about.

While the implementation of channels is left to the [ceci-channels](https://github.com/odf/ceci-channels) library, the aim of ceci-core is to build a solid foundation for this task while providing features that are also useful on their own. It is in some ways similar to libraries such as [co](https://github.com/visionmedia/co) which integrate asynchronous, non-blocking calls into a more traditional control flow through the use of ES6 generators, but puts a higher emphasis on composability and seamless concurrency.

Installation
------------

Install as a Node package:

```
npm install ceci-core
```

For easier integration, precompiled code (via [regenerator](https://npmjs.org/package/regenerator)) is included that runs on ES5 engines without generator support. To use this version, require it as follows:

```javascript
var cc = require('ceci-core');
```

Client code that uses go blocks still needs to run on an engine that supports generators or be precompiled into ES5-compliant code, for example with [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) and the [regeneratorify](https://github.com/amiorin/regeneratorify) plugin.

When running on a JS engine that supports generators directly, such as NodeJS 0.11.x with the `--harmony` option, use the following line instead:

```javascript
var cc = require('ceci-core/es6');
```

Tutorial
--------

###Go Blocks

Go blocks provide concurrent 'threads' of execution within a single Javascript thread. Let's look at a simple example:

```javascript    
var cc = require('ceci-core');

console.log("I am main");

cc.go(function*() {
  yield console.log("I am go block 1");
  yield console.log("I am go block 1");
});

cc.go(function*() {
  yield console.log("I am go block 2");
  yield console.log("I am go block 2");
});

console.log("I am also main");
```

The output looks like this:

    I am main
    I am also main
    I am go block 1
    I am go block 2
    I am go block 1
    I am go block 2

Two go blocks are created by calling the `go` function with a generator argument (using the `function*` keyword). The blocks run after the main program is finished. Whenever an expression preceded by `yield` is encountered, the current go block pauses after evaluating the expression, so that the other one can run.

###Deferreds

Things get more interesting when we add asynchronous calls to the mix. The following code wraps a Node-style callback into a deferred value:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var cc = require('ceci-core');

var readFile = function(name) {
  var result = cc.defer();

  fs.readFile(name, function(err, val) {
    if (err)
      result.reject(new Error(err));
    else
      result.resolve(val);
  });

  return result;
};
```

This pattern will look quite familiar to those who have worked with promises, but Ceci's deferreds are much simpler. Here's how we can use them in go blocks:

```javascript
cc.go(function*() {
  console.log((yield readFile('package.json')).length);
  console.log((yield readFile('LICENSE')).length);
  console.log((yield readFile('README.md')).length);
});
```

The output looks something like this:

    885
    1090
    8753

A `yield` with an expression that evaluates to a deferred suspends the current go block. When the deferred is resolved, the block is scheduled to be resumed with the resulting value. From inside the block, this looks exactly like a blocking function call, except for the fact that we needed to add the `yield` keyword.

###Running Things in Parallel

The code above reads the three files sequentially. We can instead read in parallel while still keeping the output in order by separating the function calls from the `yield` statements that force the results:

```javascript
cc.go(function*() {
  var a = readFile('package.json');
  var b = readFile('LICENSE');
  var c = readFile('README.md');
  
  console.log((yield a).length);
  console.log((yield b).length);
  console.log((yield c).length);
});
```

Finally, we can split the code into independent go routines that run concurrently:

```javascript
var showLength = function(filename) {
  cc.go(function*() {
    console.log(filename + ':', (yield readFile(filename)).length);
  });
};

showLength('package.json');
showLength('LICENSE');
showLength('README.md');
```

The order of the output lines now depends on which reads finished first and can be different between runs.

###Deferreds vs Promises

Another point worth noting is that Ceci's deferreds are not meant to be passed along and shared like promises. They are basically throw-away objects with the single purpose of decoupling the producer and consumer of a value. This is because Ceci's higher-level facilities for composing asynchronous computations are based on blocking channels as in Go rather than promises, and the extra functionality such as support for multiple callbacks or chaining is not needed at this level. That said, Ceci also lets us apply a `yield` directly to a promise, which can come in handy when working with libraries that already provide these. To demonstrate, here's a drop-in replacement for the `readFile` function above using the [q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/tree/v0.9) library:

```javascript
var Q = require('q');
var fs = require('fs');

var readFile = Q.nbind(fs.readFile, fs);
```

###Composing Go Blocks

To be useful in practice, go blocks need to be able to return values, so that we can reuse smaller building blocks to form larger ones and finally whole programs. The return value of a `go` call is simply a deferred that will resolve to the return value of the generator that defines the go block. To see this in action, let's write a `fileLength` function based on `readFile`:

```javascript
var fileLength = function(name) {
  return cc.go(function*() {
    return (yield readFile(name)).length;
  });
};
```

This allows us to rewrite the original 'main' function like this:

```javascript
cc.go(function*() {
  console.log(yield fileLength('package.json'));
  console.log(yield fileLength('LICENSE'));
  console.log(yield fileLength('README.md'));
});
```

Note that in the current version of the library, the value returned from within the go block will always be wrapped in a deferred, which means that it needs to be an immediate value. If you have a deferred, say `x`, that you'd like to pass out, you will need to write your return statement as `return yield x;`. 

###Error Handling Basics

If you've tried any of the examples above, you may have noticed that we don't see anything like a top-level stack trace when things go wrong, for example when a file to be read does not exist. Instead of working with fixed file names in our example, we can try taking a command line argument to see this more clearly:

```javascript
cc.go(function*() {
  console.log(yield fileLength(process.argv[2]));
});
```

Now if we run the program with an existing file, we get a number. For a non-existent file, we get no output and no error messages whatsoever. Let's fix this:

```javascript
cc.go(function*() {
  console.log(yield fileLength(process.argv[2]));
}).then(null, function(ex) { console.log(ex.stack); });
```

On my system, this produces something like this:

```
Error: Error: ENOENT, open 'package.jsonx'
    at /home/olaf/Projects/Ceci/ceci-core/test.js:9:21
    at fs.js:195:20
    at Object.oncomplete (fs.js:97:15)
```

This is obviously better, as it gives us an indication of what went wrong and where the error happened. In fact, the first line number mentioned happens to be the one in which the deferred returned by `readFile` is rejected in case of an error. So we can see here that rejected deferreds manifest as exceptions when these deferreds are forced via a `yield`. 
We also see that errors can bubble up through a chain of nested go blocks. More precisely, an uncaught exception within a go block causes the deferred result of that block to be rejected, which in turn leads to an exception in the calling go block when that result is forced, and so on.

###More on Error Handling

Ceci's error handling has a few subtleties: first, errors can only be propagated outward if each nested go block in the chain is actually forced with a `yield`. Second, the outmost go block in the call chain has nowhere to propagate to, so we need to explicitly establish an exception handler for it, as we have done in the example. Third, since normal stack traces reflect the Javascript call chain, which is different from the chain of go blocks, we miss a lot of useful information. For instance, there's no mention of `fileLength` or the 'main' go block in the above.

To fix the last problem, ceci-core has a global option `longStackSupport` (named after the analogous option for the [q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/tree/v0.9) library) which can be used as follows:

```javascript
cc.longStackSupport = true;

cc.go(function*() {
  console.log(yield fileLength(process.argv[2]));
}).then(null, function(ex) { console.log(ex.stack); });
```

With this switch on, I see something like this:

```
Error: Error: ENOENT, open 'package.jsonx'
    at /home/olaf/Projects/Ceci/ceci-core/test.js:9:21
    at fs.js:195:20
    at Object.oncomplete (fs.js:97:15)
    at Object.Ceci.go (/home/olaf/Projects/Ceci/ceci-core/lib/src/core.js:49:45)
    at fileLength (/home/olaf/Projects/Ceci/ceci-core/test.js:18:13)
    at /home/olaf/Projects/Ceci/ceci-core/test.js:26:21
    at Object.Ceci.go (/home/olaf/Projects/Ceci/ceci-core/lib/src/core.js:49:45)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/olaf/Projects/Ceci/ceci-core/test.js:25:4)
    [...]
```

Much more useful!

Enabling `longStackSupport` incurs some extra memory and runtime costs for each go block execution, so it is probably best to only use it in development.

###What's Next?

Go blocks and deferreds get us out of "callback hell" and avoid the typical fragmentation of program logic associated with asynchronous programming. They are a great solution when all we need is to chain together a number of asynchronous calls with some interspersed computation. But the real power of asynchronous computation comes from the ability to do things concurrently, which leads to the problem of maintaining and communicating state. A typical approach is for asynchronous pieces of code such as handlers and callbacks to communicate via variables in a shared context, but this can lead to all the well-known problems of shared mutable state.

As an alternative, [ceci-channels](https://github.com/odf/ceci-channels) provides blocking channels, borrowed from the Go language, and from Clojure's core.async, as a message passing abstraction on top of go blocks and deferreds.
